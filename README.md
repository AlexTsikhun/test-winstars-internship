The task was done in Kaggle notebooks (because I haven't powerful GPU) and before upload to Github.

In next step I used:
```python 
$ jupyter nbconvert --to script [YOUR_NOTEBOOK].ipynb
```
for convert .ipynb to .py.

In my work I have shown that I am familiar with CNN and related topics. For better result can be used augmentation techniques, deeper NN and tuning hyperparameters - it takes a little more time.
